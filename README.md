Download and install all files to local or regular hosting. (The application will not 
work without a server!).

On the screen you can see a rectangular area. Random shapes are generated inside 
the area with random colors. The shapes fall down from top to bottom. The falling 
is controlled by the Gravity Value. 

If you click inside the rectangle, a random shape of random color will be generated 
at mouse position and start falling. If you click a shape, it will disappear. If you 
click on a shape, all shapes of the same type will change the color. 

In the top left you have two text fields, one showing the number of shapes being 
displayed in the rectangle. The other text field shows the surface area (in px^2) 
occupied by the shapes. 

In the bottom you will add a couple on controls:

-/+ increase or decrease the number of shapes generated per second 

-/+ increase or decrease the gravity value
